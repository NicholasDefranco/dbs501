Evaluate this PL/SQL block and state what will be the Output after its execution(ignoring the message “ PL/SQL procedure successfully completed”)? 

SET  SERVEROUTPUT ON

DECLARE

        V_HOLD 		BOOLEAN;  
        V_TOTAL 	NUMBER :=3;
	V_CLASSMIN 	NUMBER :=4;

BEGIN

	IF(V_TOTAL > V_CLASSMIN) THEN
        	V_HOLD := NOT (V_HOLD);
        END IF;
          
        IF  V_HOLD = TRUE THEN
        	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Here');
        ELSIF V_HOLD = FALSE THEN
        	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('There');
        ELSE
        	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Nowhere');
        END IF;

END;   

Answer:
Nowhere

Question 2

Which of the following is not a valid structure in PL/SQL?

Watch for syntax

Question 3

After this block executes what is true about the change to the database?

DECLARE

	V_MAJOR         BOOLEAN;
	V_NUM 		INTEGER := 10;

BEGIN

	INSERT INTO departments(department_id, department_name)
		VALUES(900,'COMPUTER SCIENCE');


        IF NVL(V_MAJOR,FALSE) THEN
		V_NUM := V_NUM -1;
        END IF;

	IF V_MAJOR THEN
                ROLLBACK;
        ELSIF V_NUM < 10 THEN
		COMMIT;
        ELSE
                SAVEPOINT a;
        END IF;

END;  

Only the user that ran this block will see the changes(SAVEPOINT a was executed and thus user is still in the middle of a transaction).


Question 4


If the value of x is 600 then which of the statements will execute?


IF X > 1200 THEN
	STATEMENT A;
ELSIF X > 490 THEN
	*STATEMENT B;*
ELSIF X BETWEEN 50 AND 1200 THEN
	STATEMENT C;
ELSE
	STATEMENT D;
END IF;

 


Question 5

The error in this block happens because of error in which line?

                  1   DECLARE

                  2       V_COUNTER     INTEGER :=1;

                  3   BEGIN

                  4       WHILE V_COUNTER <= 10   LOOP 

                  5             DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(V_COUNTER);

                  6             IF V_COUNTER = 5 THEN

                  7                      EXIT;

                  8             END IF;

                  9             V_COUNTER := V_COUNTER + 1;

                  10       END WHILE; <- Should be END LOOP

                  11       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(V_COUNTER);

                  12  END;



Question 6

What happens when a DELETE statement in a Block with an Exception Handler returns NO rows?

No execption is thrown. DELETE or UPDATE statements may modify 0 or more rows without throwing any execption.

Question 7

Which of the following commands successfully opens the declared cursor?

CURSOR C_STUDENT(P_ID NUMBER) IS

	SELECT LAST_NAME

	FROM STUDENTS

	WHERE ID = P_ID;


Syntax:

OPEN c_student(<some value of NUMBER type>);


Question 8

You create an INDEX BY  table called student_names. Which of the following  commands may  populate the second row in the table with the name JOHN? Only one option may be correct.

student_names(<index>) := 'JOHN';


Question 9

Which cursor attribute evaluates to TRUE when an unsuccessful fetch has occurred?

%NOTFOUND


Question 10

Which value is stored in C1%ROWCOUNT if the cursor has performed two successful fetches up to that time and the third FETCH statement has been issued?

2


Question 11

What can be possible value of the Index by Table Column?

Quoted from Oracle Database 11g: PL/SQL Fundamentals
"
INDEX BY tables have only two columns:
	A column of integer or string type that acts as the primary key. The key can be numeric,
	either BINARY_INTEGER or PLS_INTEGER. The BINARY_INTEGER and
	PLS_INTEGER keys require less storage than NUMBER. They are used to represent
	mathematical integers in a compact form and to implement arithmetic operations by using
	machine arithmetic. Arithmetic operations on these data types are faster than NUMBER
	arithmetic. The key can also be of type VARCHAR2 or one of its subtypes. The examples in
	this course use the PLS_INTEGER data type for the key column.

	A column of scalar or record data type to hold values. If the column is of scalar type, it can
	hold only one value. If the column is of record type, it can hold multiple values.
"

Question 12

Explicit Cursor may use FOR LOOP, and in that case which statement is correct?

FOR implicitly_declared_cursor_name IN cursor_name LOOP
	-- implicitly_declared_cursor_name will hold the data corresponding to the currently processing row in the active set
END LOOP;
